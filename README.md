# jengrant-Portfolioproject

## This project has been my favorite project I have completed in all of my BAIS classes. I enjoyed the aspect of an individual portfolio project that I would be able to use throughout the rest of my life to display my skills, history, contact info, etc. I know that I will make sure to show future employers and professors what I accomplished as the final product of this project. 
## The project involved 3 sprints, the first one creating the portfolio/adding details. The second was puttting together a google anlaytics campaign. And the third was creating a report on the visitor traffic and adding relative information to our Github accounts for users to see. Information both pertaining to this project, and other previous projects we have completed.
